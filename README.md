# [Bank Telemarketing Analysis](https://nikhilkr31.github.io/bank-tele-marketing/)
## Overview
In this Jupyter notebook,  we will be performing EDA on the [Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) from the UCI Machine Learning repository. And consectively, build Classification models to solve the problem statement and compare the results amongst various classifiers.

## Problem Statement
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

## Goal
The goal of this analysis is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit using various classification models and compare the performance results.
